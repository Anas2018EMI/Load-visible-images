# Load visible images

Scroll teh web page to see images load “on-demand”.

Descriptions:

When the page loads, those images that are on-screen should load immediately, prior to any scrolling.

Some images may be regular, without data-src. The code should not touch them.

Once an image is loaded, it should not reload any more when scrolled in/out.
